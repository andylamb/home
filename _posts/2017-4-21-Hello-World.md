# What Shape are Climbers?

Climbers have long been interested in what sort of body can be dragged up the steepest cliffs and most heinous edges. It's fascinating that body types as different as Ashima (5', ~90lbs) and Jan Hojer (6'2'', ~170lbs) can both excel at the sport. So what does the data on 8a say? Let's dig in!

I considered three different populations:
- All the climbers on 8a that listed both height and weight (these fields are optional on the bio). This group had 25375 climbers.
- The subset of climbers that had at least 10 ascents 8a or harder. This group had 599 climbers.
- The subset of climbers that had at least 10 ascents 8b or harder. This gropu had 98 climbers.
